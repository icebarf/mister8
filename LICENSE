4a. WORK is defined as code, documentation, or anything that the LICENSE
    is shipped with. Unless any specific WORK stipulates it is to be treated
    under different terms, the appropriate TERMS shall apply to the WORK.
5.  This LICENSE must be preserved.
    You are not granted the permission to change, modify, swap, or do anything
    that disturbs the LICENSE.
6.  All original copyright information must be retained.
    The copyright information must be shipped with the source code, and the 
    compiled program as well. The information could be in the form of this 
    license or any other form, with addendums to the Copyright information 
    header if any modifications are made.
7.  If there is any confusion regarding the LICENSE terms, one must contact the
    copyright holder(s) via any provided means of communication to discuss them
    and reach a resolution or decision. This should be done before making any 
    modifications or redistributing.
7a. If there are more than one copyright holders, then for a decision to be valid
    there must be a clear majority in support of the decision.
7b. If no majority is formed in support, then the decision is invalid.
7c. Decisions made in (7) are applicable to all similar situations once 7(a) and
    7(b) are upheld.
7d. All above subsections of 7, and section 7, do not distinguish between
    code and documentation copyright holders as a separate entities. However,
    decisions concerning code cannot only have documentation copyright 
    holders as the majority formers. The vice-versa is not true.
7e. The decision must be made within a reasonable period of time, 
    that is "three months".
    In case all original copyright holders are dead, inactive, or do not care,
    this LICENSE stipulates that the work be treated immediately as PUBLIC DOMAIN.

    for this unethical purpose.

11c. Exemplary documentation copyright header:
     Copyright (c) DOCUMENTATION, 2023 John Doe.
11d. 11c does not grant a "John Doe" any copyright and is only an example.
