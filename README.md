Yet another chip-8 interpreter, intended to be written cleanly.

Mostly an exercise.

### Audio

Keep a `.wav` (wave) file in the current directory where binary is executed.
The will automatically load the beep and play it as necessary.

### Behavior

This interpreter has correct behavior. Tuning quirks will be
allowed when the development time allows me to do so. The interpreter
passes Timendus's Chip-8 Test suite at the time of testing.
