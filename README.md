Yet another chip-8 interpreter, intended to be written cleanly.

Mostly an exercise.

### update: 19 October 2023, 21:12:02 IST

I have implemented correct behavior in my chip8 interpretr. I cannot believe
it took me 3 attempts to finally understand what the documentation actually meant.

Anyway, after having a correct implementation, my goals are as follows:

- Refactor code
- Implement Audio Buzzer
- Implement quirks
- Add configurability for various options
- Implement a UI encompassing everything mentioned above.
- Maybe port to another platform.
